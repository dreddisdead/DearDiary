Title: Happy B-Day Cats!
Today is a special day. Winnie and Loui turn two years old and Abby and I celebrated with a mini party and song. We crafted cute little paper party hats that they ABSOLUTELY hated lol. I ended up editing party hats on their little kitty heads. Of course they had no idea what was going on. To them, it was jsut normal dinner time and they've been clearly starving for centuries. I love these cats.
